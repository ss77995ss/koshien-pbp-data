Collect Japan High School Baseball Tournament pitch-by-pitch data

## Overview
Currently, will only collect `Koshien(甲子園)` pitch-by-pitch data.

Some of the pitch data would not have `pitch_speed` or `pitch_type`.

The `pitch_result` and `pitch_type` column would be Japanese. Will update them into [Statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs) like format

## Credits
All data are from [一球速報.com](https://baseball.omyutech.com/). I will close this repo if they ask.

They provide not only pitch-by-pitch data but also well-managed baseball data from every level. Go check out as well!
